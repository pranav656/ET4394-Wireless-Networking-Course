# ET4394-Wireless-Networking-Course
Hi. This repository contains the work I have done as a part of 'Wireless Networking Course' at Delft University of Technology. There are three
components to this repository. One deals with RFID signal identication, other deals with network simulation using ns3 and the third one deals with GNU radio.
